# Python Videoprocessing Toolbox

Are you also sick of non-free, shady ad and malware contaminated programs to do simple things such as recording your screen or exporting some frames of a video to pictures?

## pyFrameexporter
This tool can export every Nth frame from a video stream. It can be used to export single frames (or all frames) from a video as JPG images. The output resolution of the images can be set as well. Uses OpenCV videoCapture.

## pyStreamrecorder
This tool can record videos from various sources (streams, webcam and video files) using OpenCV and save to AVI. The output video name, resolution and framerate can be set as well.

Supported formats:
- RTMP Streams
- RTSP Streams
- AVI
- MOV
- MP4
- and probably some more

## Coming Soon:
- pyScreenrecorder: record areas of the screen
